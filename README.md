### About
This is a project based on a blog series I'm writing on medium on how to:

1. Prepare a React Native app for **release/production**
2. How to distribute your app to **Firebase App Distribution**
3. How to **automate** the build and distribution of your app using Fastlane
4. Build a CI/CD pipeline using **Fastlane**, **Github Actions**, and **Firebase App Distribution**
